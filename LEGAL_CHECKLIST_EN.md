# Legal Checklist (Informational) for a Promotional Contest in Italy

**DISCLAIMER:** This document is an informational summary based on Italian regulations (DPR 430/2001). It does not constitute legal advice. It is mandatory to consult with a lawyer or a specialized agency in Italy to ensure full compliance for your project.

---

### 1. Correct Classification: "Concorso a Premi" (Promotional Contest)

Your project must be structured as a **promotional contest** linked to the sale of a product or service, not a lottery where a ticket is the sole item being sold.

- **What's allowed:** "I buy a DR7 Empire product/service and also receive a free entry into the prize draw."
- **What's forbidden (State monopoly):** "I buy a lottery ticket."
- **Action:** Your communication and terms of service must be clear that participation is a promotional benefit tied to a purchase, not the purpose of the transaction itself.

### 2. Drafting a "Regolamento" (Official Rules)

A detailed set of official rules is mandatory. It must be written in Italian and be available for inspection.

- **Required Content:**
    - **Promoting Entity:** Who is organizing the contest (DR7 Empire, with full legal details).
    - **Duration:** Start and end dates for participation.
    - **Territory:** "Italian territory."
    - **Participation Method:** How to enter (e.g., following a purchase on the website).
    - **Prize Details:** A precise description of each prize and its commercial value (excluding VAT).
    - **Drawing Mechanics:** Date, location, and method for the final draw.
    - **Winner Notification & Prize Delivery:** How winners will be notified and how prizes will be delivered (must occur within 6 months).

### 3. Administrative Procedure (MIMIT)

The administrative process is strict and must be followed precisely.

- **Prior Notification:** You must notify the **Ministero delle Imprese e del Made in Italy (MIMIT)** at least **15 days before** the contest begins.
- **PREMA On-line Platform:** This notification must be submitted through the "PREMA" online service.
- **Security Deposit (Cauzione):** A deposit (via bank deposit or insurance bond) equal to **100% of the total prize value** must be paid to MIMIT. It is returned 180 days after the contest ends if all rules were followed.

### 4. The Prize Draw ("Estrazione")

The draw cannot be a simple `random()` script. It must be officially certified.

- **Presence of an Official:** The final prize draw must take place in the presence of a **public notary** or an **official from the local Chamber of Commerce**.
- **Action:** You must hire a notary to supervise and validate the draw. Using a random number generator (like `random.org`) is acceptable, but the act of "drawing" and certifying the winning number must be done under the official's supervision.

### 5. Prizes ("Premi")

- **Allowed Prizes:** Goods (items, real estate), services, shopping vouchers, etc.
- **Forbidden Prizes:** **Cash**, stocks, financial securities, company shares, life insurance policies.

### 6. Taxation

- **Tax on Prizes:** Prizes are subject to a withholding tax (IRPEF) that the promoting company (DR7 Empire) must pay on behalf of the winner. The rate is typically around 25%.
- **Action:** This tax must be budgeted in addition to the value of the prizes.
