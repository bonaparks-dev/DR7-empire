## 📊 Monitoring

### Netlify Function Logs

Watch for these indicators:

**Success**:
- ✅ `Email confirmation sent successfully`
- ✅ `[CarWash] ✅ Confirmation email sent successfully via webhook`
- ✅ `Calendar event created successfully`

- ⚠️ `Booking saved but email notification failed. Webhook backup will send notifications.`

**Errors**:

### Supabase Database

Check regularly:
```sql
-- Recent car wash bookings
SELECT id, created_at, customer_name, customer_email, payment_status, stripe_payment_intent_id
FROM bookings
WHERE service_type = 'car_wash'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Recent lottery tickets
SELECT id, created_at, full_name, email, ticket_number, payment_intent_id
FROM commercial_operation_tickets
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If booking doesn't appear in database:
1. Check Netlify function logs for database errors
2. Verify RLS policies allow inserts
3. Check Stripe webhook logs
4. Look for `[CarWash]` entries in webhook logs

### If emails aren't sent:
1. Check Netlify logs for email errors
2. Verify Gmail credentials in environment variables
3. Check for rate limiting errors
4. Verify webhook backup triggered

### If admin panel doesn't show booking:
1. Verify admin panel connects to same Supabase project
2. Check RLS policies allow admin user to read bookings
3. Refresh admin panel page
4. Check browser console for errors
