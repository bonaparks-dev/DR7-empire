# 🎁 Gift Card System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview

The gift card system is now fully integrated into your commercial operation! Every ticket purchase automatically generates a €25 gift card that customers can use on their next purchase.

## ✅ System Features

### Gift Card Details
- **Value**: €25 per gift card
- **Validity**: 24 months from issue date
- **Activation Date**: December 26, 2025
- **Important Rule**: **NON-CUMULATIVE** - Only 1 gift card per transaction
- **Currency**: EUR only (no USD support)
- **Qualification**: Issued with every ticket purchase (1+ tickets)

### Automatic Generation
- Gift cards are created automatically when a customer purchases commercial operation tickets
- Customer receives a beautiful bilingual email with their gift card code
- Code format: `GIFT-XXXXXXXX` (8 alphanumeric characters, excludes confusing chars like I, O, 0, 1)

### Redemption
- Customers can enter their gift card code during checkout
- System validates the code in real-time
- Discount is applied immediately
- Gift card is marked as redeemed after successful payment

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration

You need to run the migration in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `/supabase/migrations/20251226000000_gift_cards.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL

This creates:
- `gift_cards` table with all necessary columns
- Indexes for fast lookups
- RLS policies for security
- Helper functions for expiry management

### Step 2: Verify the Table

Run this query to confirm the table was created:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'gift_cards';
```

You should see columns:
- `id` (uuid)
- `code` (text)
- `initial_value` (integer)
- `remaining_value` (integer)
- `currency` (text)
- `status` (text)
- `issued_with_booking_id` (uuid)
- `issued_at` (timestamp)
- `expires_at` (timestamp)
- `redeemed_at` (timestamp)
- `redeemed_in_booking_id` (uuid)
- `recipient_name` (text)
- `recipient_email` (text)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

## 🔧 Environment Variables

No new environment variables needed! The system uses your existing:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `GMAIL_USER`
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## 📧 Email Notifications

Gift card emails are sent automatically through the Stripe webhook when a payment succeeds.

### Email Features:
- **Bilingual**: Italian and English in the same email
- **Beautiful HTML design**: Professional gradient header, clear code display
- **Gift card code**: Prominently displayed in large, bold text
- **All details included**: Value, expiry date, usage instructions
- **Non-cumulative warning**: Clear notice that only 1 gift card can be used per transaction

### Sample Email Content:

```
🎁 GRAZIE PER IL TUO ACQUISTO!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE!

🇮🇹 La tua Gift Card è pronta!
Come ringraziamento per il tuo acquisto, ti regaliamo una Gift Card del valore di €25!

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Scenario 1: Purchase Tickets and Receive Gift Card

1. **Purchase Tickets**:
   - Go to `/commercial-operation`
   - Buy at least 1 ticket (€20)
   - Complete payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Check your email for the gift card

2. **Verify in Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM gift_cards
   WHERE recipient_email = 'your-email@example.com'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

3. **Check Email**:
   - Look for email from DR7 Empire
   - Subject: "🎁 Il tuo Regalo DR7 – Gift Card da €25 / Your DR7 Gift – €25 Gift Card"
   - Note the gift card code

### Test Scenario 2: Redeem Gift Card

1. **Start New Purchase**:
   - Go to `/commercial-operation` again
   - Select quantity: 2 tickets (€40)

2. **Apply Gift Card**:
   - Scroll to "🎁 Have a gift card?" section
   - Enter your gift card code
   - Click "Apply"
   - Verify discount appears: -€25
   - New total should be: €15

3. **Complete Purchase**:
   - Click "Buy Tickets"
   - Complete payment
   - Gift card should be marked as redeemed

4. **Verify Redemption**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM gift_cards
   WHERE code = 'YOUR-CODE-HERE';
   ```
   - `status` should be "redeemed"
   - `redeemed_at` should have a timestamp
   - `remaining_value` should be 0

### Test Scenario 3: Try to Use Expired/Invalid Gift Card

1. **Test Invalid Code**:
   - Enter: `GIFT-INVALID1`
   - Should show error: "Gift card not found"

2. **Test Already Redeemed**:
   - Use a code you already redeemed
   - Should show: "This gift card has already been used"

3. **Test USD Currency**:
   - Switch currency to USD
   - Gift card input should be disabled
   - Notice: "Gift cards can only be used with EUR currency"

## 🔍 Monitoring and Management

### View All Gift Cards
```sql
SELECT
  code,
  status,
  remaining_value / 100.0 as value_eur,
  recipient_email,
  issued_at,
  expires_at,
  redeemed_at
FROM gift_cards
ORDER BY issued_at DESC;
```

### Active Gift Cards
```sql
SELECT
  code,
  remaining_value / 100.0 as value_eur,
  recipient_email,
  expires_at
FROM gift_cards
WHERE status = 'active'
  AND expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY expires_at ASC;
```

### Redeemed Gift Cards
```sql
SELECT
  code,
  recipient_email,
  issued_at,
  redeemed_at,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM (redeemed_at - issued_at)) as days_until_redemption
FROM gift_cards
WHERE status = 'redeemed'
ORDER BY redeemed_at DESC;
```

### Expired Gift Cards (Manual Check)
```sql
-- Run this function to mark expired cards
SELECT expire_gift_cards();

-- View expired cards
SELECT code, recipient_email, expires_at
FROM gift_cards
WHERE status = 'expired'
ORDER BY expires_at DESC;
```

### Gift Card Statistics
```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(initial_value) / 100.0 as total_issued_eur,
  SUM(remaining_value) / 100.0 as total_remaining_eur,
  SUM(initial_value - remaining_value) / 100.0 as total_redeemed_eur
FROM gift_cards
GROUP BY status;
```

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Integration (Optional)

To add gift cards to your admin dashboard, use this query:

```typescript
// Fetch gift cards with booking details
const { data: giftCards } = await supabase
  .from('gift_cards')
  .select(`
    *,
    issued_booking:bookings!issued_with_booking_id(id, customer_name, customer_email),
    redeemed_booking:bookings!redeemed_in_booking_id(id, customer_name, customer_email)
  `)
  .order('issued_at', { ascending: false });
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Non-Cumulative Rule
- **Only 1 gift card per transaction**
- System enforces this on the frontend
- Backend validates before redemption
- Clearly communicated to customers in emails

### Currency Restriction
- **EUR only**
- USD purchases do not qualify for gift cards
- USD customers cannot redeem gift cards
- Clear warning shown when USD is selected

### Activation Date
- System active from: **December 26, 2025**
- Gift cards issued before this date: None (system not active yet)
- Date is hardcoded in constants

### Automatic Expiry
- Gift cards expire 24 months after issue date
- Run `SELECT expire_gift_cards();` periodically (or set up a cron job)
- Expired cards cannot be redeemed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Gift Card Not Created After Payment

1. **Check Stripe Webhook**:
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
   - Verify webhook is active
   - Check recent events for `payment_intent.succeeded`

2. **Check Logs**:
   - Netlify Functions → Logs
   - Look for `[GiftCard]` prefix
   - Common errors:
     - Database connection issues
     - Email sending failures (non-blocking)

3. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM gift_cards
   WHERE issued_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY issued_at DESC;
   ```

### Gift Card Validation Failing

1. **Check RLS Policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'gift_cards';
   ```

2. **Verify Service Role Key**:
   - Make sure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in Netlify
   - Should start with `eyJ...`

### Email Not Sending

1. **Check Gmail Settings**:
   - Verify `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` are correct
   - Test with: `npm run test-email` (if you have a test script)

2. **Check Email Logs**:
   - Webhook logs should show email sending attempts
   - Look for SMTP errors
