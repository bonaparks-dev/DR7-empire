# Car Wash Booking - Supabase Setup Guide

## Database Configuration for Car Wash Bookings

The car wash booking system uses the existing `bookings` table in your Supabase database. No new tables are needed - we're reusing the same structure!

## ‚úÖ Current Database Structure

Your existing `bookings` table already has all the required columns:

### Required Columns (Already Exist):
- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `user_id` (uuid, nullable - allows guest bookings)
- `service_type` (text) - Will be set to `'car_wash'`
- `service_name` (text) - Wash package name
- `service_id` (text) - Package ID (full-clean, top-shine, vip, dr7-luxury)
- `price_total` (integer) - Price in cents
- `currency` (text) - EUR
- `customer_name` (text)
- `customer_email` (text)
- `customer_phone` (text)
- `appointment_date` (timestamp)
- `booking_details` (jsonb) - Contains:
  - `carMake` (string)
  - `carModel` (string)
  - `carYear` (string)
  - `licensePlate` (string)
  - `additionalService` (string)
  - `additionalServiceHours` (number)
  - `notes` (string)
- `status` (text) - pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled
- `payment_status` (text) - pending, paid, refunded
- `booked_at` (timestamp)
- `created_at` (timestamp, auto)
- `updated_at` (timestamp, auto)

## üîß No Changes Needed!

The good news: **Your existing `bookings` table already supports car wash bookings!**

The structure was designed to handle multiple service types, so car wash bookings will automatically integrate with your existing system.

## üìä How It Works

### Car Wash Booking Example:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid-or-null",
  "service_type": "car_wash",
  "service_name": "LAVAGGIO VIP",
  "service_id": "vip",
  "price_total": 7500,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "customer_name": "Mario Rossi",
  "customer_email": "mario@example.com",
  "customer_phone": "+39 123 456 789",
  "appointment_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
  "booking_details": {
    "carMake": "Mercedes",
    "carModel": "GLE 63s AMG",
    "carYear": "2023",
    "licensePlate": "AB123CD",
    "additionalService": "supercar",
    "additionalServiceHours": 2,
    "notes": "Please pay extra attention to the wheels"
  },
  "status": "pending",
  "payment_status": "pending",
  "booked_at": "2025-10-03T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Car Rental Booking Example (for comparison):
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "vehicle_type": "car",
  "vehicle_name": "Mercedes GLE 63s AMG",
  "pickup_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
  "dropoff_date": "2025-10-18T10:00:00Z",
  "price_total": 35000,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "booking_details": {
    "customer": { ... },
    "insuranceOption": "KASKO_BLACK",
    "extras": ["gps", "child_seat"]
  },
  "status": "pending",
  "payment_status": "pending"
}
```

## üîç Querying Car Wash Bookings

### Get All Car Wash Bookings:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE service_type = 'car_wash'
ORDER BY appointment_date DESC;
```

### Get Pending Car Wash Bookings:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE service_type = 'car_wash'
  AND status = 'pending'
ORDER BY appointment_date ASC;
```

### Get Today's Car Wash Appointments:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE service_type = 'car_wash'
  AND DATE(appointment_date) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY appointment_date ASC;
```

### Get User's Car Wash History:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here'
  AND service_type = 'car_wash'
ORDER BY booked_at DESC;
```

## üîê Row Level Security (RLS)

Your existing RLS policies should already cover car wash bookings. If you need to verify:

### Check Current Policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'bookings';
```

### Typical Policies Needed:
1. **Users can view their own bookings:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own bookings" ON bookings
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

2. **Users can create bookings:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookings" ON bookings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id OR user_id IS NULL);
```

3. **Admin can view all bookings:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view all bookings" ON bookings
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin' OR
    auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_account'
  );
```

## üìß Email Notifications (Optional)

To send confirmation emails for car wash bookings, you can use your existing `send-booking-confirmation` Netlify function. Just update it to handle `service_type = 'car_wash'`:

```typescript
// In netlify/functions/send-booking-confirmation.ts
if (booking.service_type === 'car_wash') {
  // Send car wash confirmation email
  mailOptions.subject = `Car Wash Appointment Confirmed - ${booking.service_name}`;
  mailOptions.html = `
    <h1>Appointment Confirmed!</h1>
    <p>Service: ${booking.service_name}</p>
    <p>Date: ${new Date(booking.appointment_date).toLocaleString()}</p>
    <p>Vehicle: ${booking.booking_details.carMake} ${booking.booking_details.carModel}</p>
    <p>Total: ‚Ç¨${booking.price_total / 100}</p>
  `;
}
```

## üéØ Admin Dashboard View

To add car wash bookings to your admin dashboard, filter by `service_type`:

```typescript
// Fetch car wash bookings
const { data: carWashBookings } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('service_type', 'car_wash')
  .order('appointment_date', { ascending: true });
```

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Database table exists (`bookings`)
- [x] All required columns present
- [x] RLS policies configured
- [ ] Test creating a car wash booking via the UI
- [ ] Verify booking appears in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] (Optional) Update email notifications
- [ ] (Optional) Add car wash bookings to admin dashboard

## üöÄ Testing

1. Go to `/car-wash-services` on your website
2. Click "PRENOTA ORA" on any service
3. Fill out the booking form
4. Submit the booking
5. Check Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí bookings
6. Look for the new row with `service_type = 'car_wash'`

## üìù Notes

- **Guest Bookings**: Users don't need to be logged in. `user_id` can be `NULL` for guest bookings.
- **Price Format**: Always stored as cents (e.g., ‚Ç¨75.00 = 7500)
- **Appointment Times**: Stored in UTC, display in local timezone
- **Additional Services**: Stored in `booking_details.additionalService` and `additionalServiceHours`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied for table bookings"
**Solution:** Check RLS policies. Either disable RLS temporarily or add proper policies.

### "null value in column violates not-null constraint"
**Solution:** Check which column is required. Most fields should be nullable except:
- `price_total`
- `currency`
- `status`
- `payment_status`

### Booking appears but no data in booking_details
**Solution:** Check the JSONB column. The data should be a valid JSON object.

**You're all set! No database changes needed. Just start using the car wash booking system! üéâ**
