# Urban Cars - Supabase Setup

## What You Need to Do in Supabase

### âœ… Good News!
The existing `bookings` table already supports urban cars. No new tables needed!

### ðŸ“‹ Existing Database Schema
The `bookings` table handles all vehicle types (exotic supercars, urban cars, etc.) with these fields:
- `vehicle_name` - stores car name (e.g., "VW T-ROC", "Fiat Ducato Maxi")
- `vehicle_type` - stores type ("car" for both exotic and urban)
- `vehicle_image` - stores image path
- `price` - daily rental price
- All other booking details (dates, location, insurance, etc.)

### ðŸŽ¯ What Urban Cars Are Available

| Car | Daily Price | ID |
|-----|-------------|-----|
| VW T-ROC | â‚¬49 | urban-car-201 |
| VW Tiguan | â‚¬59 | urban-car-202 |
| Cupra Formentor | â‚¬49 | urban-car-203 |
| Citroen C5 Aircross | â‚¬29 | urban-car-204 |
| Fiat Ducato Maxi | â‚¬79 | urban-car-205 |
| Fiat Panda | â‚¬29 | urban-car-206 |
| Fiat 500X | â‚¬39 | urban-car-207 |

### ðŸ“¸ Images Needed
Add these images to `/public` folder:
- `/troc.jpeg`
- `/tiguan.jpeg`
- `/cupra.jpeg`
- `/c5.jpeg`
- `/ducato.jpeg`
- `/panda.jpeg`
- `/500x.jpeg`

### ðŸš€ How It Works
1. User goes to `/urban-cars` page
2. Sees grid of available urban cars (same layout as exotic supercars)
3. Clicks "Book Now" â†’ opens CarBookingWizard
4. Completes booking â†’ saves to `bookings` table in Supabase
5. Receives confirmation email at dubai.rent7.0srl@gmail.com

### âœ… No Migration Required
The existing database schema already supports urban cars through the `bookings` table. The booking wizard handles both exotic supercars and urban cars identically.

### ðŸ“Š Tracking Bookings
To see urban car bookings in Supabase:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE vehicle_name IN ('VW T-ROC', 'VW Tiguan', 'Cupra Formentor', 'Citroen C5 Aircross', 'Fiat Ducato Maxi', 'Fiat Panda', 'Fiat 500X')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Or filter by ID prefix:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE id LIKE 'urban-car-%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
